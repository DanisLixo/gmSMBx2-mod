GENERAL INFO

mods go to "AppData/Local/TouchedgmSMB/mods/" due to game maker 2022 weird directory mistake

custom sprites do not scale ingame yet. they should stay proportional to mario's size if they need to be any bigger for some reason
your hitbox will always stay the same no matter the sprite size
to export spritesheets properly, aseprite should work

every character by default needs the following sprites:

Idle (Big & Small)
Walk (Big & Small)
Jump (Big & Small)
Pivot/Skid (Big & Small)
Die (Small)
Swim (Big & Small)
Climb (Big & Small)
Fireball Throw (Big)
Shrink (Big to small)
Grow (Small to big)
Crouch (Big, small is optional)
Dance (Optional, Big Or Small)
Poiting (Small & Big)
Palette Sheet (Optional, tho it's good to have one)

your palette sheet should have every color in the base sprite in a row at the top, this is the "base palette"
copy this row and move it down 1 pixel, this is the "default palette"
copy this row and move it down 1 pixel, then edit the colors for the fire flower palette
from this point onward, any extra rows are custom palettes you can equip in the options menu
the palette sprite (probably) will handle as many colors and custom palettes you want, for perfomance measures, better stick with at least 16 palettes

it is recommended that grow and shrink stay at 14 and 17 frames in length respectively for timing ingame

for guns tho, it only needs:

Gun
Bullet
Bullet drop

and none of them are obligatory for the gun to appears on the customization menu.

MAIN.INI INFO

the id is the name of your sprites that will be added under internally, for guns, there's no id. make sure this does not conflict with any other mods you have on. it cannot have any spaces in it
for frame counts, just type out a sprite name in the correct area, put an equals after it and then a number to specify frame count

(you may be able to modify sprites of the game)

you can declare x and y origins for specific sprites by adding xOrigin and yOrigin respectively after the sprite name

for guns, it's the same thing, their offsets is defaulted but different guns sizes need to offset.

SOUND INFO

All in-game sounds are customizable.
these sounds MUST be .ogg files!!!!
they need to be in a folder named "sound" and need to be named like this:

sndJump_ID
sndJumpbig_ID
musGO_ID

for guns, you can't, bcuz i'm lazy idk

ID is the id for the character that is set in main.ini

the game's music are also in the sound folder and are named like this: musOW (OverWorld), musUG (UnderGrounds, or Uncle Grandpa), musUW (UnderWater), musCS (CaStle), musStarman
for end themes: musLevelend, musCastleend, musToadstool
for online: musLobby, musRace, musChallenge
for the extra level is musRetro

if you want your song to have the CLASSIC channels effect, isolates the song intruments into 4 channels (the limit), and name them mus[Song]_c0, mus[Song]_c1, mus[Song]_c2, mus[Song]_c3

for sounds, there are a lot, so go search on the source code https://github.com/DanisLixo/gmSMBx2-mod/tree/mod-x2/sounds
